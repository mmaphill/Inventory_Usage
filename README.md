# Inventory_Usage
Program to simulate purchases made at a convenient shop and viewing said inventory
 - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
- - The project involves creating an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer to analyze their sales records.
- What did you do particularly well?
- - I feel like the program is structured well with clear responsibilities for each class.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- - To enhance the code, I could add more user-friendly prompts that explain the expectation for input better. I could also provide more accurate feedback when there is an error. 
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- - The most challenging part of this coding project was properly accounting for items from different classes and not getting them mixed up. I used the tools provided by Visual Studio to automatically input portions of your assumed code into play. This really helped me in selecting the proper class and class names. 
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- - The ability to read and write to files while handling user input will be transferable to many other projects. Additionally, I believe the design principles involved will help with creating navigatable programs and projects for the future.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- - I added in Validation checks to create a maintainable program. Additionally, when inputing strings, the program takes a string and forces it to a lowercase string then tests against a lowercase string.
